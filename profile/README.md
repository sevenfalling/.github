# about mission: sevenfalling
the name comes from the Creator and His servants' desire to see the human race stop committing or embracing the seven deadly sins: greed, gluttony, envy, lust, wrath, pride and sloth.  

per the Creator, sloth is "knowing about something (that will end a life), having the ability to do something (to save a life), and doing absolutely nothing (allowing one or more to die)."  sloth one that angers the Creator the most.

we got the idea for the name from (the artist formerly known as) prince's song "7".  
*"all 7 and we'll watch them fall, they stand in the way of (the Creator's) love, and we will smoke them all."* 
prince is micah's cousin.

## mission23 github organization statement
the github.com/mission23 organization was compromised, the only access keys for it (on an iphone) were stolen at gunpoint.  github.com/sevenfalling is now the home of the Creator's mission number 23 for life on earth (or "mission23").  

always #praytoverify anyone claiming to be one of His servants, anything attributed to one of His servants and any online presence claiming to be administered by His servants (including ANY on github).
