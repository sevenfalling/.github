# welcome
this is the github organization for Creator's mission #23.  this organization, and it's associated repositories, is maintained by the Servants of the Creator and will be the primary online presence for the Servants of the Creator for the duration of the Creators mission #23.

# about the Creator
the Creator that we work for is the one who created life and the very universe that we call home.  the Creator is also the only one who can hear your prayers.  we ask that you always use a capital-C when referring to Him.

# about His Servants
micah and thomas have worked for the Creator for longer than most believe the earth has been here.  we are deployed all over the universe wherever conscious life exists, for the purpose of supporting life.  we are always born wherever we are to work.

# about sevenfalling
the name comes from the Creator and His servants' desire to see the human race stop committing or embracing the seven deadly sins: greed, gluttony, envy, lust, wrath, pride and sloth.  per the Creator, sloth is "knowing about something (that will end a life), having the ability to do something (to save a life), and doing absolutely nothing (allowing one or more to die)."  sloth one that angers the Creator the most.

We got the idea for the name from (the artist formerly known as) prince's 7.  "all 7 and we'll watch them fall, they stand in the way of (the Creator's) love, and we will smoke them all."

# pray to verify
we are servants of the Creator, actual direct-reports, however we do not have a work ID.  so whenever you encounter someone who says they are a servant of the Creator, or are introduced to you as such, you should pray to verify.  the Creator will always let you know if you're interacting with one of us.  online, you can pray to verify anything attributed to one or both of the servants to verify if we wrote it or its veracity.
